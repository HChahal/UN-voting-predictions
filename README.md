# UN-voting-predictions
Predicting state preferences on foreign policy based on UN voting data.

This project looks to estimate state preferences on foreign policy based on UN voting data. The dataset contains information on every UN member countries’ votes (yes, no, abstentions, non-voting) by year (since 1946) by topic (e.g., human rights, disarmament, etc.) in the UN General Assembly (UNGA) and Security Council (UNSC).

We estimate that our model can predict with reasonable accuracy a state’s vote on any resolution based on the topic area and the votes of the five permanent UNSC members. Out of the two—topic area and correlation with UNSC permanent members—we expect correlation with UNSC permanent members to be a stronger predictor of state preferences.

Hypothesis: A country’s historical voting correlation with the world powers (specifically, the five permanent members of the UN Security Council) is a stronger predictor of how it will vote in the future than the issue at hand.
